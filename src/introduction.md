This work expresses cetain technical juddgments by the author based on observation and experience but not on outcomes of scientific testing. No IRBs have been needed orsought. No student data in any form has been reported outside of official reporting channels. It was an experience of figuring out just how much of the ____ could be cut as distraction while revealing all of the required context of the course, in better ways that can be done in CS2: first-order discrete math courses.

## Two Pillars of Computer Science

Computation and reasoning are two great partially intertwined pillars of computer science. Consequently we have languages for expressing *conputations*, namely *programming* languages, and languages for expressing *propositions* over diverse structures and for reasoning about their properties: of being unsatisfiable, satisfiable, or valid.  

The use of programming langauges to specify computations is familiar territory even to the earliest computer science students. Expressions in reasoning languages, by contrast, express propositions about given *worlds* along with valid forms of reasoning about the truth, or satisfiability, or validity of such propositions in particular worlds. 
Two connected linguistic pillars of the field are *programming* Languages and *reasoning* languages.

In languages like the one we use in this coures, they are interwoven intricately into a unified linguistic whole enabled by an amazing conceptual unification, the Curry-Howard correspondence. It names the insight that formalized reasoning of fundamental kinds can be cast as programming. Proofs are programs! That idea is the hook for engaging computer scientists: explain it in terms they they already understand and love.

## Stepping Back: Some Problems

That we arrived here is entirely understandable. The demand for programming was voracious, and the cost of reasoning was prohibitively high. Theory, languages, tools, thriving communitities, and real demand drives curriculuar choices. But now the winds are turbulent. Generative and related AI still appear to hold promising of reduced demand for entirely hand-typed programming code. But what's even more impressive is now rapidly growing demand for students with real fluency not only in programming language and thinking, but in the abstractions and dynamics of reasoning, including, but not limited to, reasoning about computations.

This goal for this course is to contribute to addressing this shortfall by radically replacing the traditional undergraduate CS2  course in discrete mathematics around the wildly successful reasoning and computation language, Lean 4. The course is scope for one undergraduate semester. The material on theory extensions and SMT solvers is recommended at this level as optional, and shuold probably be skipped on a first teaching of the course.

## The Pillar Ignored

To the extent that reasoning and the theories, languages, and tools that support it, are taught, they generally appear in a standard second course for majors, namely *discrete mathematics and theory (DMT1)*. This course teaches students to use propositional logic (syntax, semantics, model theory), first-order predicate logic and set theory, proof-theoretic validity and proof construction skills, and induction, typically only for proofs and only over natural numbers.

The overarching intellectual construct as seen by students is untyped, but properly stratified, first order logical and set theory. These courses are also generally paper-and-pencil affairs. In the end, I am afraid to suggested, they are received as among the least relevant, least memorable courses in the entire curriculum. There is little apparent connection to students' known intrinsic interests in *computation*, and little or no perceived utility in the subject matter. The result, over generations of students, is that even top BS graduates and entering graduate students generally have graduate no experience with reasoning or with contemporary enabling theories, languages, tools, communities, and industrial needs. 

## The Practical Problem

This state of affairs is understandable as the outcome of a decades-long history during which reasoning languages were arcane, tool support was minimal, one needed graduate education to use them, very few people used them, and demand came only from rare exceptional projects.

Times have now changed. We now have clearly successful reasoning theories, languages, technologies, and communities enabling deep and substantially automated reasoning across many domains of discourse  employing the natural abstractions and notations of all of the respective domains.  Exponentiating the effect is rapidly growing industrial demand for graduates who are prepared to *hit the ground running* when it comes to useing these capabilities for productive reasoning.

In this author's experience, few if any incoming graduate students have any degree of fluency in any of the reasoning languages of computer science, not even in important aspects of propositional logic.Most new graduate students incoming to a recent class did not confidently know how to reason about implications. Yet we take for granted that all incoming grad students will have working fluency in at least one and almost certainly multiple styles of *computational* thought and expression.

## The Radical Purpose of This Course

With support provided in part by a research grant from the National Science Foundation (#1909414, SHF: Small: Explicating and Exploiting the Physical Semantics of Code), the author has developed this course as a model for full-out replacement for the traditional undergraduate course in discrete mathematics and theory, and as a first major unit of a graduate course for students with little prior experience with formal langauges and reasoning. Several big changes in in circumstances make right now a great time to consider this significant transition in CS pedagogy. They include the following:

- Rapidly increasing industrial demand for formal reasoning about systems that undergird our society
- The emergence of type-theory-based formalisms with exceptional expressiveness and broad applications
- The development of superb automated tooling for using reasoning languages effectively in practice
- The distinct possibility that routine program generation is increasinly handled by generative AIs

The author thus proposes that now it is finally time to remediate the deep imbalance in our pedagogy, until now focused overwhelmingly on languages and methods programming, and barely at all on reasoning. This course is thus offered as a wholesale replacement for the traditional second undergraduate course in computer science, discrete mathematics and theory (DMT). 

## The Secret Sauce

Perhaps key insight behind the design of this course is that the Curry-Howard correspondence provides the essential bridge to connect students' intrinsic interest in computing with what hitherto had been arcane and apparently not very useful or in-demand subject matter. The course by contrast emphasizes the essential computational nature of logical reasoning. After teaching semantic validity for simple propositional logic, with an emphasis on a subset of propositional forms that emerge as the axioms of deducative reasoning in predicate logic, the course moves directly into predicate logic as embedded in the type theory of the Lean 4 prover.

A second design principle is that all of the concepts to be taught must be teachable in the main formal logic taught in the course. First-order logic just won't do in this regard. In first-order predicate logic, for example, one can state what it means for a particular relation to be symmetric, but one cannot formalize what it means for any binary relation on a set to be symmetric because, of course, one cannot quantify over relations. And yet it is this more abstract kind of reasoning that students need to learn. The course assumes that higher-order predicate logic embedded in type theory with inductive definitions, e.g., using Lean 4, is far preferable to spending the better part of a semester on first-order theory, in which one cannot formalize even the content of the course in which it's being taught. We now know how to formalize mathematics. Use Lean, or Roqc, or something similar.

## Design Constraints

This course was developed under a few key constraints:

- Continue to focus on the basic content of the traditional course: logic, sets, induction
- Avoid assiduously overwhelming early students with the complexity of modern proof assistants
- Formalize every concept in the uniform logic of the proof assistant using conventional notations
- Ensure that first-order theory is a special case of the more expressive theory of the course
- Provide students with a deeply computational perspective, from great tooling to Curry-Howard 

## The Solution

The solution, now tested in practice, has a few key elements:

- Make the standard embedding of predicate logic in Lean the main logic students learn
- Begin with a deep embedding of propositional logic syntax, semantics, and validity in Lean 4
- Thoroughly cover all of the axioms for reasoning in predicate logic as its embedded in Lean 4
- Build all of the material on sets, relations, and properties thereof on top of this logic
- Present induction first as a way to build programs, and only later on as a way to build proofs
- Aggressively limit covereage of Lean; e.g., the tactic language is off the table until the end

## An Example

Here are two simple examples of what students will see in this course. The first illustrates how students would write propositional logic expressions. The second gives an example of how they would write, and then use, the definition of a certain property of a relation.

First, this is a snippet of some "code" for propositional logic, the syntax and semantics of which they have seen how to specify.

- def andAssociative  := ((P ∧ Q) ∧ R) ↔ (P ∧ (Q ∧ R))
- def equivalence     := (P ↔ Q) ↔ ((P ⇒ Q) ∧ (Q ⇒ P))

Second, here's an example of the specification of the property of a relation being well founded.

- def isWellOrdering  {α  β : Type} : Rel α α → Prop := fun r => ∀ (s : Set α), s ≠ ∅ → ∃ m, (m ∈ s ∧ ¬∃ n ∈ s, r n m)

By the end of the course students should be able to read and explain what this definition means, with an explanation roughly as follows. A relation, r, on a set, α, is said to be well ordered if any non-empty set of α values has a least element. That is, there is some m in the set such that there is no other value, n, in the set that is "less than" m under r.

## Status

The status of this online book is *emerging*. In this spring of 2025, the author is teaching an introductory graduate course called *software logic.* As nearly all graduate students in the class have no meaningful background in reasoning languages and practice, the undergraduate course is the first major part of the graduate course. As the semester goes along, more and more fo the undergraduate course material from previous semesters will appear here.  Check back once in a while for updates if you're interested.

## Lean 4 for CS Pedagogy

Lean 4 has thoroughly proven itself as an outstanding language for the clear, concise, and useful formalization of abstract mathematics, far beyond what is needed in a first course in discrete mathemtics and theory. That said, it's an exceptionally good vehicle for teaching this course because it's fabulously and naturally expressive of the ideas to be taught (unlike first-order theory); it engaged students through their interest in computation and computational tools; and it sets student on a path not only to firmer intellectual foundations but to a new era in computer science, with AIs taking over routine programming and humans now increasingly needed for complex reasoning about programs.

## Paths Forward

From here, advanced courses in several areas are possible at both undergraduate and graduate levels, including programming language design and implementation, software verification, provable security, machine learning (e.g., see AlphaProof), and ultimately the higher mathematics of robotics, quantum computing, cyber-physical systems, control systems, concurrent systems, and many other domains. 

## Humility

There are issues and opportunities for improvement at all levels of this document, from the lexical to the conceptual. If you feel inclined to provide input, even of the more critical variety, please don't hesitate to send it along.
