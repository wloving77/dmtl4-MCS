# Propositional Logic

This page is under construction. 

This chapter presents the syntax and semantics of *propositional logic*
(PL) as an example of a general, formal and declarative language meant to
support human and mechanized reasoning. In this way, it departs from the
framing set up in the first chapter, on Languages.

This page will give a brief history of Boolean algebra and propositional
logic before the rest of the chapter gets to formalizing things. We cover
PL syntax, Boolean algebra as the semantic domain, variable interpretations,
semantic evaluation, and the general idea of evaluating logical propositions
over structures that represent possible worlds within which a given expression
might be true or not.

Exercises in this chapter provide students with opportunities to start using
Lean by (1) extending the syntax, both abstract and concrete, with additional
connectives corresponding to other Boolean operators (xor, nand, nor, etc.);
(2) extending the semantics accordingly.
