# mathlib

Lean's mathlib is where the mathematical community's formalizations
of lots of different parts of mathematics live. There are riches here,
for almost any application.

The upshot for you at this point is that, once you master the next part of the course, on predicate logic in Lean 4, you can pick nearly any area
of mathematics and reason in it, now with the full support of Lean, its infrastructure, and vibrant community.

The great thing is that, unlike first-order theory, Lean admits the practical, abstract, expressive, and verified embedding of an incredible diversity of logical and mathematical structures into its foundational logic; and of course in the higher order logic of Lean, all of this is properly abstract, e.g., wherein one can speak formally about abstract properties of relations, or about such things as *real* real numbers. Neither is feasible in first-order predicate logic. In Lean: no problem.

Make no mistake, first-order predicate logic with first-order theory of sets and relations is still an utterly indispensable language. It's syntax is used in many important reasoning systems, incluiding Z3, Dafney, Alloy, and others. But with knowledge of Lean, you *also* have immediate access to this *incredible* treasure trove of verified mathematical knowledge, *and* it's nearly trivial to understand first-order logic once you have seen the bigger picture.

If you're interested in a visual overview of areas of mathematics that Lean 4's mathlib provides, the overview of mathlib in [Lean 3](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-overview.html) is the best right now. The [Lean 4 version](https://leanprover-community.github.io/theories.html#lean-mathematical-theories) is evolving and contributions are welcome.
