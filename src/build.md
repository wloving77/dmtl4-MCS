# Getting Started

The DMTL4 book is largely generated from Lean 4 source. You can experiment with
all of the examples in the VS Code IDE. First, follow the [Lean 4 quickstart][1] to
install VS Code, Lean, and the Lean 4 extension. Second, [install `git`][2] and
clone your fork of the repository. Next, open the repository in VS code.
Finally, open the notes you wish run. The book's Lean code can be found in the
`code/DMT1/Lectures/` directory.

## Building DMTL4

If you wish to generate the book yourself there are additional steps and
dependencies you will need.

First, install [`mdbook`][4].  

Then, install the Haskell installer, [`ghcup`][5].  

Add `ghcup`'s bin directory (`$HOME/.ghcup/bin`) to your `PATH`.  

Next, launch the TUI and install `ghcup`'s recommend Haskell version.  

Lastly, if not already installed, install `make` on your platform.

At this point you should be able to build the book. From the top-level
directory run `make all`. This will transform the code (in `code/DMT`) into
markdown (in `src/DMT1`) for the book.

Finally, you can serve up the book for browsing with `mdbook serve --open &`.
Conveniently, any changes to the `src` directory will cause the book to be
rebuilt automatically.

### Install Scripts

Manual installation instructions will be replaced with automated install
scripts over time. We welcome any and all contributions to this effort.

### Windows

Not available at this time.

### macOS

The dependencies described above can be installed on macOS via [homebrew][6] with the
following commands.

```bash
brew install mdbook ghcup

# Assuming bash. Tweak if using a different shell.
echo 'PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.ghcup/bin' >> "$HOME/.bashrc"

ghcup install ghc recommended
ghcup set ghc recommended
```

## Other

Note, Windows users using git via [git bash][3] and the command line should take
care to select the appropriate shell in the VS Code terminal. It will do to
set git bash as the terminal by changing Settings: Terminal > Integrated >
Defafult Profile: Windows and selecting it there. Thereafter, launching a
terminal in VS Code will launch one with a git bash shell. You can see what's
possible there in the configuration section and eventually configure your own
setup for terminal sin VS Code.
