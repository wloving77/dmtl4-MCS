# Semantics of First-Order Predicate Logic

ChatGPT answers,


Domain of Discourse (DD): A non-empty set of objects over which variables range.

Interpretation (II):
    Assigns a meaning to each constant (cc), predicate (PP), and function (ff).
    Constants map to elements of DD.
    nn-ary predicates map to subsets of DnDn (tuples of domain elements).
    nn-ary functions map to nn-ary operations over DD.
Variable Assignment (σσ): A mapping of variables to elements of DD.

Evaluation:

    Atomic Formula: A predicate P(x1,...,xn)P(x1​,...,xn​) is true if (σ(x1),...,σ(xn))∈I(P)(σ(x1​),...,σ(xn​))∈I(P).
    Logical Connectives: Truth is determined using classical truth tables (e.g., ¬,∧,∨,→¬,∧,∨,→).
    Quantifiers:
        ∀x.ϕ(x)∀x.ϕ(x) is true if ϕ(x)ϕ(x) holds for all x∈Dx∈D.
        ∃x.ϕ(x)∃x.ϕ(x) is true if ϕ(x)ϕ(x) holds for some x∈Dx∈D.

A formula ϕϕ is true in an interpretation II if, under all valid variable assignments, ϕϕ evaluates to true.
